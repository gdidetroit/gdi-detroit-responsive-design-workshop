##Course Description:
>What's the big deal about Responsive Design?  
The big deal is that there are now 1.75 billion smartphone users worldwide. Somewhere, someone is using their smartphone to book a flight because they missed their connection; check their account balance before making a purchase; find the closest urgent care center. And someone is at their wit's end after pinching, zooming, and panning all over the website just to complete the simplest task - because it was designed for the desktop.   
Responsive design helps end this madness and makes websites easier to use, on whatever device a website is viewed on. This workshop will provide a basic understanding of responsive design from concept to code, and give you the tools and resources to create a responsive website.   
PREREQUISITES: Participants should have a basic understanding of HTML & CSS, enough to be comfortable editing it and inspecting it in the browser.
